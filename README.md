# AnotarTodo
AnotarTodo is a simple file annotation tool that allows you to add comments to files or folders. Simply drag and drop files onto the tool, and you can add comments on the right side of the window. The tool will keep these comments until you remove the item from the list.

Getting Started
To get started with AnotarTodo, follow these steps:

Download the latest release from the repository.
Extract the files to a folder on your computer.
Double-click on the anotar_todo.exe file to launch the tool.
Drag and drop files onto the tool to add them to the list.
Add notes to the files by selecting them and typing in the notes field.
To remove a file from the list, select it and click on the "-" button.

# Adm√°s
This tool originated from a casual conversation between my brother and me. I used ChatGPT and Google to help me complete it, which was my attempt to see if ChatGPT could help programmers complete a project. I proved that if given enough prompts, ChatGPT can basically implement some functionality.
By the way, this readme was essentially completed by ChatGPT.

However, it also has the following issues:

1. It is not responsible for the accuracy of the program. In fact, there are many errors in the code that need to be manually verified.
2. It may be difficult to implement a long-term project, but if it is only used to implement a single function, it is fully capable (still needs to be manually verified), and its efficiency is very high.
3. Issues with coding standards. In fact, I think ChatGPT's code is really beautiful, but it does not conform to all coding standards. However, if we propose these standards during its coding process, it should be able to solve this problem very well.
4. Sometimes it produces code that does not meet the requirements at all. Some code is completely unnecessary, and some code cannot complete the function, which is very strange.

I do not believe that ChatGPT can replace programmers. On the contrary, it can help programmers complete a project faster and save a lot of tedious work. A qualified programmer combined with ChatGPT can play the greatest role.

Perhaps some people think that improving efficiency means that companies can lay off more employees and pay less wages. Well, this is a problem, but this is not ChatGPT's problem. It is just another excuse for capitalists to exploit and also because the government is too weak to protect workers. I believe these issues will be solved someday.
